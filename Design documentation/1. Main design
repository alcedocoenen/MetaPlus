Main design of Plus-Minus

1. load plusminus score
1a. load squarepages => from csv to dict
1b. load notepages => from csv to dict

2. define setup
2a. number of layers
per layer:
    2b. order of pages per layer
    2c. mapping with notepages per layer
config: dict with number of layers, plus for each layer an order of squarepages (list) and order of notepages (list).
main function: ComposeLayers
result: large dict of all squares, divided in layers


3. re-arrange squares
3a. replace increase/decrease
3b. re-arrange squares with brackets

4. define type repetitions with flag values

5. define change: pitch or duration

1. Basic Score Setup
DefineNumberOfLayers: Number of layers has to be defined.
MapPages: For each layer, the mapping and order of pages has to be defined
BracketFilling: The brackets have to be filled with the right number of squares
ChangeSubstitutions: The increase and decrease signs have to be replaced according to the page instructions.
Function	input	output
DefineNumberOfLayers	max (int)	numberOfLogicalLayer (int)
MapPages	max (int)	logicalLayerList (list of tuples)
BracketFilling	OriginalSymbolPage	LogicalSymbolPage
ChangeSubstitutions	OriginalSymbolPage	LogicalSymbolPage
