Approach:
1. First define score data in a structured way. Format JSON.
2. Define main functions to transform initial data into music data. MIDI file format
    1. Define ways to play MIDI file
    2. Define ways to represent MIDI notes (see pyknon)
    3.
3. Define simple interactions to define variables.
4. Define framework for Flask interactions
5. Define ways to visually represent:
    1. original score
    2. intermediate status
    3. playing the score (scrolling through the squares)
6. Define ways to define variables in a visual way
7. Collect all into an attractive (web) app
8. Define ways to store settings and MIDI scores
9. Define ways to create new scores ("meta")
10. Define ways to represent music differently than MIDI (audio?)


TO DO
1. Set up basic files and folder structures
2. Define user stories
3. Tutorial OO in python
